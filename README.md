# MNIST-Image-Classification
Image classification task via SVM implemented from scratch including PCA for dimensionality reduction

Multi-Class Classification Project:
• PCA, SVM, Kernels
• MNIST dataset was used, consisting of grayscale images of
handwritten digits with dimensions of 28 × 28 pixels. The objective
was to classify the digits shown in the images, involving a 10-class
classification problem.
• To reduce dimensionality, PCA was implemented from scratch.
• In addition, an SVM model was built from scratch, incorporating the
RBF kernel trick. The SVM model was trained using the
reduced-dimensionality data obtained from PCA.
• "From scratch" implies that the PCA and SVM models were created
without relying on existing libraries or pre-built functions.
